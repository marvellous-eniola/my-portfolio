          “Aaronn was fantastic to work with from start to finish. We were
          looking for a simple, stand-out logo and he delivered. I tried
          designing the logo myself thinking I wouldn’t need to pay the money
          for a professional graphic designer but I was very wrong. Working with
          Aaronn was worth every penny and was surprisingly affordable! I
          remember him saying simplicity is key to a successful logo and boy he
          was right. I can’t thank Aaronn enough for his effort and
          professionalism. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a
          design!”
